**The wild journey from Domain Specialist to Domain Developer that understands the complexities of the technology that powers the fixed income markets and uses agentic coding to build practical solutions.**

With over 20 years of global experience in the fixed income sector, I bring a deep commitment to finance, having collaborated with industry leaders in London, New York, San Francisco, and Dallas. My career has been driven by a passion for the **digitization and electrification of bond markets**—transitioning from using the tools to architecting them.

### 🏛️ The Fixed Income Journey

#### **Laying the Groundwork in Financial Technology**

My career began at [**Bloomberg LP**](https://www.bloomberg.com/), implementing and promoting the [**Trade Order Management System (TOMS)**](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/trading/order-management-system/toms/) for regional broker-dealers and banks. This provided the foundational understanding of how technology optimizes trading operations and market efficiency.

#### **Expanding in Sales and Trading**

In 2010, I transitioned to **Vice President** roles at Dallas-based broker-dealers, overseeing electronic trading systems. I developed innovative trading strategies and platform capabilities that delivered significant revenue growth while deepening my knowledge of algorithmic and platform-based trading solutions.

#### **Fostering Innovation in London**

As European Client Relationship Manager at [**Algomi Ltd**](https://www.algomi.com/) in London, I specialized in tailored trading solutions, including the deployment of **ALFA** (liquidity aggregation) to tier-1 asset managers.

#### **Entrepreneurial Endeavor: CatFIX Technology**

In 2019, I founded [**CatFIX Technology, Inc.**](https://www.catfix.biz/), a cloud-native FIX protocol engine aimed at modernizing fixed income marketing for regional banks—leveraging technology to address evolving market demands and improve operational workflows.

### 🚀 The Katana Labs Mission: From Advisor to Owner

From 2020 to 2021, I launched a revolutionary machine learning platform that analyzed **200 million bond pairs** with **91% accuracy**. Originally an ING spin-out, Katana became my mission. I crafted its go-to-market strategy, secured its Google Cloud Partner Advantage status, and drove its integration onto the **Bloomberg Terminal** (reaching 325,000+ users).

**The Acquisition:** When liquidation loomed, I submitted an initial £9,000 bid to review the financials. To my surprise, I secured the IP for £25,000.

> _The first Google Cloud invoice, nearly matching my bid, marked a turning point. It prompted me to pause everything and dedicate myself to mastering cloud management to preserve Katana’s potential._
