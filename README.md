I am not a developer. 

I was the sales guy that all developers hated b/c I used to say "it can't be the hard to develop"

Here is my story:<br>
A stroke of serendipity brought me into the orbit of pioneering minds at ING and Katana Labs, where I somehow acquired the
creation of their state-of-the-art intellectual property. Over years of dedication, they refined an intricate architecture pivotal in
pinpointing mean-reverting fixed income pair trades.

Immersed in a sea of complex systems, I utilize anything and everything to help me learn the fundamentals of data engineering, devops and cloud ecosystems.
Though the ascent of the learning curve is steep, the combination of the wealth of code I acquired
with explanations from youtube, generative AI and other sources on the web help me shed light on so many concepts.

I find solace in humor, drawing parallels with The Dude's
unflappable quest in 'The Big Lebowski.' Much like his comical yet
determined search for Jackie Treehorns money in his toilet while under
duress, I too delved deeper, undeterred by the metaphorical dunking of
learning code under pressure.
