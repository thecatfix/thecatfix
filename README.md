I am not a developer. 

I was the sales guy that all developers hated b/c I used to say "it can't be the hard to develop"

Here is my story
A stroke of serendipity brought me into the orbit of
pioneering minds at ING and Katana Labs, where I somehow acquired the
creation of their state-of-the-art intellectual property. Over years of
dedication, they refined an intricate architecture pivotal in
pinpointing mean-reverting strategies for fixed income pair trades.

Immersed in a sea of complex systems, I mastered the art of maneuvering
through dense networks of pipelines and the expansive cloud ecosystem.
Though the ascent of the learning curve was steep, the wealth of code I
engaged with shed light on so many concepts.

I find solace in humor, drawing parallels with The Dude's
unflappable quest in 'The Big Lebowski.' Much like his comical yet
determined search for Jackie Treehorns money in his toilet while under
duress, I too delved deeper, undeterred by the metaphorical dunking of
learning code under pressure.
